Baobab is the GNOME Disk Usage Analyzer.

Baobab is a simple application which can scan either specific folders
(local or remote) or volumes and give a graphical representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also
auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.

This is the version designed for GNOME3. There is also a version
for MATE called mate-disk-usage-analyzer. Both can be installed 
together and don't conflict one with the other.
